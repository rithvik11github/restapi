    "title": "Filipino Cantaloupe Juice Recipe",
    "body": "I grew up eating cantaloupe two ways: piercing perfectly ripe cubes with a fork to shovel into my mouth, and sipping melon—sweetened cantaloupe juice—from a cold glass. I have vivid memories of drinking countless glasses of melon, a popular drink that Filipinos imbibe to beat the sweltering tropical heat. The chilled beverage is a staple in our culture—I've enjoyed countless glasses both with my grandparents in the Philippines and at a bustling restaurant in Queens, New York. Served in a tall glass with ice, the long, rounded, pastel-hued strands of cantaloupe swim in their own sweetened juice. Its mellow, floral-sweet taste will quench anyone’s thirst on a hot day."

    "body": "The number of cases in India has rapidly overtaken Brazil. The weekly average today is tens of thousands of cases more than it was on the first of August. Some expect it to cross 6 million cases by the end of this month. But that's not the only way it's going to get worse. Scientists fear a double whammy once air pollution starts spiraling."

    "body": "Since international travel on pause, people have turned to exploring their own backyards. From the U.S. to Canada to England, Europe, and New Zealand, people are getting in cars, campervans, and RVs and heading out on road trips. After all, it allows you to social distance while still getting outside!"
